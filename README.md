# Battleship (single player)

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. It is known worldwide as a pencil and paper game which dates from World War I. 
Each player has typically a grid that is 10x10. 
The rows on that grid are identified by a number, whereas the columns are identified by a letter.
Before you play the game, each player chooses where his ships are arranged.
The game is played in rounds when each player takes a turn attacking a target square in the opponentâ€™s grid by choosing a coordinate (row, col). 
If a ship occupies that square the player announces that his ship has been hit, otherwise it was a miss.

NOTE:
This is a simpified version of the game, where there is only a single player. 
The player plays against a computer generated grid that contains one ship (4 squares/blocks) where the position is randomized.
The target of the game is to sink the ship in the least number of trials.
The user should keep guessing until he fully sinks the ship.
